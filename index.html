            <h2>A Brief History of Soccer in America</h2>
            <p>While often overshadowed by American football, basketball, and baseball, soccer (or football, as it's known globally) has a long and fascinating history in the United States. Its roots trace back to the late 19th century, with various leagues forming and dissolving over the decades.</p>
            <p>The sport saw significant boosts with the arrival of international stars like Pel√© in the North American Soccer League (NASL) in the 1970s. However, it was the hosting of the 1994 FIFA World Cup that truly reignited interest and laid the groundwork for modern professional leagues and a surge in youth participation.</p>

        <section id="leagues">
            <h2>Professional Soccer Leagues</h2>
            <p>The modern era of professional soccer in the US is largely defined by Major League Soccer (MLS) and the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Major League Soccer (MLS):</strong> Founded in 1993 as a condition of hosting the 1994 World Cup, MLS has grown from 10 teams to over 29 today. It has steadily gained popularity, attracting international stars and developing homegrown talent. The league's focus on stadium development and a passionate fanbase has contributed to its success.</li>
                <li><strong>National Women's Soccer League (NWSL):</strong> The premier professional women's soccer league in the US, the NWSL features many of the world's top female players, including stars from the US Women's National Team. It has gained significant traction, especially after the USWNT's World Cup victories.</li>
                <li>Beyond these, numerous lower-tier professional leagues like the USL Championship and MLS NEXT Pro provide pathways for players and extend the reach of professional soccer across the country.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>US National Soccer Teams</h2>
            <p>Both the Men's and Women's National Teams have played crucial roles in elevating soccer's profile in the US and globally.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>US Men's National Team (USMNT):</strong> The USMNT has regularly qualified for the FIFA World Cup and has shown progress on the international stage, with many players now competing in top European leagues. Their performances often spark national interest in the sport.</li>
                <li><strong>US Women's National Team (USWNT):</strong> The USWNT is one of the most successful national teams in women's soccer history, boasting multiple FIFA Women's World Cup titles and Olympic gold medals. Their dominance and advocacy for gender equality have made them global icons and inspirations.</li>

            <h2>Youth Soccer Development</h2>
            <p>The foundation of soccer's growth in the US lies in its massive youth participation. Millions of children play soccer annually, making it one of the most popular youth sports.</p>
            <p>This extensive grassroots involvement feeds into various levels of development, from recreational leagues to competitive club soccer, high school teams, and collegiate programs (NCAA). Initiatives like MLS NEXT and the Girls Academy are further professionalizing youth development, aiming to produce more elite players for domestic leagues and national teams.</p>

            <h2>The Future of Soccer in the USA</h2>
            <p>The outlook for soccer in the United States is overwhelmingly positive. Key factors contributing to its continued growth include:</p>

                <li><strong>Demographic Shifts:</strong> A growing Hispanic population, deeply passionate about soccer, further bolsters the fanbase.</li>
